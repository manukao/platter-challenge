Using the following tech stack:

- `HTML`
- `JavaScript`
- `TailwindCSS`

The main objective of this tech challenge is to see your ability to create designs using `TailwindCSS` and well structured semantic `HTML`.

The design needs to be fully responsive (desktop/mobile). Please use plain JS (VanillaJS) for any functionality. The scrollbar thumb should increase to 6px height when hovering / touching it.

The Show More button (mobile only) should trigger a dropdown revealing the other product cards.

Hint: We are looking for pixel perfection and strict adherence to the directions

Bonus task:Migrate the design into a Shopify Section, using liquid and a schema input on a development store. (This can be mocked up without the dev store)
Objective:The aim is to see your thinking & process along with creating the designs.Please create a Git Repository for the work and add as many Commits as you think will help showcase your development process.Once Completed:Please send through a link to the completed Git repository. The preview should be as simple as opening the main HTML file, or alternatively host the example online for preview. There should be no local build step required to review the final result.
